## üåê Unified EVM Architecture

EVM Lens features a **revolutionary unified EVM architecture** that creates a realistic blockchain simulation environment:

### üîó How It Works

**Traditional Approach (Isolated Playgrounds):**
```
Playground A: [Deploy Contract] ‚Üí Isolated EVM State A
Playground B: [Fund Account]   ‚Üí Isolated EVM State B
‚ùå No interaction between playgrounds
```

**EVM Lens Unified Approach:**
```
Timeline: 10:00 AM - Deploy Contract (Playground A)
         10:05 AM - Fund Account (Playground B)
         10:10 AM - Call Function (Playground A)

Unified EVM: [Deploy] ‚Üí [Fund] ‚Üí [Call] ‚Üí Shared State
‚úÖ All playgrounds see the same blockchain state
```

### üéØ Key Benefits

- **Realistic Blockchain Simulation**: Actions execute chronologically like a real blockchain
- **Cross-Playground Interactions**: Deploy a contract in one playground, use it in another
- **True State Continuity**: Account balances and contract state persist across playground switches
- **Educational Value**: Learn how real blockchain networks handle multiple concurrent transactions
- **Performance**: Single EVM initialization instead of per-playground overhead

### üìä Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Multi-Project Development**
1. **Playground A**: Deploy an ERC-20 token contract
2. **Playground B**: Deploy a DEX contract that uses the token
3. **Playground C**: Create trading bots that interact with both contracts
4. **Result**: All contracts can interact with each other naturally

**Scenario 2: Team Collaboration Simulation**
1. **Developer 1 (Playground A)**: Deploys core infrastructure contracts
2. **Developer 2 (Playground B)**: Builds application contracts on top
3. **Developer 3 (Playground C)**: Creates integration tests
4. **Result**: Realistic collaborative development environment

### Deploying an ERC-20 Token

```typescript
// Navigate to /create-contract and configure:
const tokenConfig = {
  contractAddress: "0x742d35Cc6ab8b2532c4b4b3d34d0f0d1f8b8c8d8",
  ownerAddress: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266",
  totalSupply: 1000000n,
  decimals: 18,
  bytecode: "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50...",
  abi: [
    {
      "inputs": [{"name": "_totalSupply", "type": "uint256"}],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "constructor"
    },
    // ... more ABI entries
  ]
};
```

### Executing Contract Functions

The playground interface provides:
- **Function Discovery**: Automatic parsing of read/write functions
- **Parameter Input**: Type-safe input fields with validation
- **Real-time Execution**: Immediate feedback with detailed traces
- **State Visualization**: Live updates to contract storage and balances

### Analyzing Execution Flow

- **Interactive Diagrams**: Click nodes to inspect stack/memory state
- **Animated Execution**: Visual flow of opcode execution
- **Gas Tracking**: Real-time gas consumption analysis
- **Storage Changes**: Before/after state comparisons

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

The project includes tests for:
- EVM opcode execution (80+ opcodes)
- Contract deployment and interaction
- State management and persistence
- ABI validation and parsing
- Database operations and migrations

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

EVM Lens uses SQLite with the following key tables:

- **playground**: Stores playground configurations and metadata
- **snapshot**: Records all blockchain actions from ALL playgrounds with timestamps for chronological replay

### Unified State Management

The snapshot table structure enables the unified EVM architecture:

```sql
CREATE TABLE snapshot (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  playground_id INTEGER,  -- Tracks which playground created the action
  timestamp TEXT DEFAULT (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) NOT NULL,  -- Key for chronological ordering
  payload TEXT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (playground_id) REFERENCES playground(id)
);
```

**Key Features:**
- All snapshots are loaded and executed chronologically by `timestamp`
- `playground_id` provides context but doesn't isolate state
- Actions from different playgrounds are interleaved based on creation time
- Database can be reset during development using configuration options

All database operations are type-safe using Drizzle ORM with automatic migrations.

## ‚ö° Performance Features

- **Fast Contract Deployment**: Sub-100ms deployment times
- **Real-time Execution**: Minimal latency opcode execution
- **Efficient State Management**: Optimized storage with automatic cleanup
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth interactions even with complex contracts
- **Memory Optimization**: Lazy loading and garbage collection

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT=300000
VITE_DEFAULT_GAS_PRICE=20000000000
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

### Build Configuration

The project uses Vite with:
- Node.js polyfills for browser compatibility
- Cross-Origin isolation for SharedArrayBuffer support
- Optimized bundle splitting for faster loading
- TypeScript path resolution with `@/` alias

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Contract deployment fails**
- Verify bytecode format (should start with 0x)
- Check ABI validity using the built-in validator
- Ensure sufficient gas limit (default: 300,000)

**Function execution errors**
- Validate input parameters match ABI specification
- Check account balances and permissions
- Review execution trace for specific error opcodes

**Database issues**
- Clear browser storage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Check browser console for migration errors
- Verify SQLite support in your browser

**Performance issues**
- Enable SharedArrayBuffer in browser settings
- Check for memory leaks in long-running sessions
- Use browser dev tools to profile performance
